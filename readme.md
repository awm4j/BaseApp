# BaseApp (Laravel 5.2)

I build websites for fun and am working towards building them for a living. I wanted a framework that would grow with me and wouldn't get in my way, hence Laravel.

I'm trying to build out the back-end so that I can put together sites quickly by only modifying routes/views. Plus if it's a custom app, this will provide a nice platform to get started.

Use composer to install and everything should be great. :smile:
